 Hi, I’m Akshaya :wave:

 :seedling: My first brush with technical writing was while drafting a paper on the final year engineering project.
 I vividly remember enjoying writing the paper even more than working on the project.

:woman_technologist: I landed my first job as an Application Developer after my graduation.
I was a part of a small team, and that aspect helped me to get acquainted with all the phases of software development - from the coding stage to the deployment and support phase.
During that time I had the opportunity to work on some of the documents, for the application we were working on.
And yet again, I loved the whole process of crafting the document.

:bulb: That’s when I realized that I enjoy explaining complex information rather than writing code.

In the years following that, I worked on drafting user manuals, tutorials, How- guides, Reference and POC documents etc. I also got an opportunity to work with the Pre-sales team on gathering information and drafting functional requirements and scope documents. As a freelance technical content writer authored SEO-based articles on the cloud, DevOps etc.

As a Technical Writer, here's how I can help a tech company:

- Passionate about researching things and figuring them out. I'm keen to design a document from scratch or discover undocumented features and correct incomplete or outdated guides.

- Structure and organise the information with logic and clarity. Have created a knowledge base from the ground up and ensured that the knowledge base of 500+ documents was fully integrated with new and updated content across the team.

- I love distilling complex technical information that helps bridge the gap between the product and the user. I am always happy to suggest ways of improving the end product to make it more user-friendly.
