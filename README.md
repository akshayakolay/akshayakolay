 Hi, I’m Akshaya :wave:

 :seedling: My first brush with technical writing was while drafting a paper on the final year engineering project.
 I vividly remember enjoying writing the paper even more than working on the project.

:woman_technologist: I landed my first job as an Application Developer after my graduation.
I was a part of a small team, and that aspect helped me to get acquainted with all the phases of software development - from the coding stage to the deployment and support phase.
During that time I had the opportunity to work on some of the documents, for the application we were working on.
And yet again, I loved the whole process of crafting the document.

:bulb: That’s when I realized that I enjoy explaining complex information rather than writing code.

In the years following that, I worked on drafting User Manuals, Tutorials and  How to Guides, knowledge articles, POC documents, etc.
I also got an opportunity to work with the Pre-sales team on gathering information and drafting functional requirements and scope documents.  

But like it is said, change is the only constant. A year ago, I moved to Sweden with my husband away from my home country (India). Since it was a cultural shift, I tried to get myself acclimatized to the new setup and freelanced.

I am curious to learn new things and to broaden my spectrum as a technical writer, I took up courses on basics of DITA XML and API Documentation.
