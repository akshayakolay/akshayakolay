 Hi, I’m Akshaya :wave:

 :seedling: My first brush with technical writing was while drafting a paper on the final year engineering project.
 I vividly remember enjoying writing the paper even more than working on the project.

:woman_technologist: I landed my first job as an Application Developer after my graduation.
Since we were a small team we were involved in all the phases of software development – from the coding phase to the deployment and support phase.
During that time I had the opportunity to work on some of the documents, for the application we were working on.
Again, I enjoyed the whole process of crafting the document.

:bulb: That’s when I realized that I enjoy explaining complex information rather than writing code.

In the years following that, I worked on drafting User Manuals, Tutorials and  How to Guides, knowledge articles, POC documents, etc.
To get an overall understanding of a project from the business point of view,
I also exposed myself to work with the Pre-sales team on gathering information and drafting, Functional requirement documents, and scope documents.  

But like it is said, change is the only constant. A year ago, I moved to Sweden with my husband away from my home country (India). Since it was a cultural shift, I tried to get myself acclimatized to the new setup and worked freelance.

I am curious to learn new things and to broaden my spectrum as a technical writer, I took up courses on DITA XML and API Documentation.
